# OpenDAC-Python-Wrapper
Python wrapper and extended Arduino code for the serial controlled OpenDAC DAC-ADC.
Original Arduino sketch provided here: http://opendacs.com/dac-adc-homepage/dac-adc-code/
Our Lab: https://trello.com/b/DvzZh9hL/sochnikov-lab-nanoscale-imaging-uconn
You will need PyQt5 installed to make use of the GUI. It is suggested that you use
Anaconda. 

# Arduino Code:
Adding some common functions and acquisition features. To be documented later.

# Python Code:
Import the OpenDAC object using "from opendacwrapper import ODAQ1". This object is still a WIP so changes will be made. To be documented later.
